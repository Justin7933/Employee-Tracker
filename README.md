# Employee-Tracker
<strong>DEMO VIDEO</strong>: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/7IYW2mWOxXHGXHbBsrDq <p>
As I did this assignment I first started with inquirer and added each prompt. Using the baseline from the acceptance criteria also had helped with the structure of the prompt as well as the structure of the data base.<p>
  <strong>##How to Start</strong><p>
  Run the app through node app.js. Frome there you can select what you want. Examples of the selected things can be view department, view employees, add employees, etc.<p>
 <strong> Use the exit to exit from the db.</strong>
